<h2><strong> About Me </strong></h2>
Hello!  


I am a Python programmer with nearly two years of experience and I am currently learning and developing my skills in the field of artificial intelligence. During this time, I have experienced a short internship in a company that gave me the opportunity to learn and improve my practical skills. 
In this course, I realized how important the quality of coding and its maintainability and development is. I understood very well the importance of writing code that is not only efficient, but also easily developable and readable. I also learned about the concepts of "Good Coding" and "Design Patterns" and came to the conclusion that having a proper structure and integrity in the codes can have a great impact on the success of a project.
In addition to technical skills, I am very interested in teamwork and cooperation with others. Being organized, having innovative and creative ideas, and enjoying working in a team environment are some of the qualities that I always highlight in my work. 
I believe that combining technical skills with team spirit is the key to success in complex and large projects and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and share my knowledge with others.







- 🌱 By day, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, conjuring up models that learn like humans (but without the need for coffee! ☕). From building and training to testing and deploying, I make sure these digital brains are top-notch!
- 👯‍♂️ On the lookout for fellow adventurers! Eager to team up on new startup quests and innovative escapades. Have an idea? Let's make it the next big thing together!
- 💬 Wizard's hat off, I'm all ears for chit-chats about Python spells, programming puzzles, AI enigmas, ML mysteries, and DL dilemmas. Got questions? I've got answers (or at least, I'll Google them really fast 😉).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to use a neural network to predict tomorrow's weather. Ended up with a model that's convinced it's always "raining cats and dogs"! 🐱🌧️🐶
